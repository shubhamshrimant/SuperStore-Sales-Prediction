# SuperStore-Sales-Prediction

## In this project, XGBRegression and Random Forest are used. Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding) is done after splitting the dataset. While adding new feature is done before splitting. 

### This is much improved project than the last few ones. 

Dataset is used from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)
